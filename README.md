ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Verners.

Little bit about me:

I began my journey in the tech world by joining the Accenture Bootcamp (a leading IT company) in 2021, where I earned an internship that launched my career in IT.
During this time, I dedicated a year to mastering AEM front-end development and Salesforce CMS development, 
while also expanding my knowledge of a wide array of development tools and technologies.

I found lot of joy in working on my own small projects, such as creating webpages and learning more about the front-end and back-end aspects of web development. 
I explored how databases and APIs function, further strengthening my skills. I also explored how smart contracts and blockchain development work, 

And then I created a small Python trading bot that fetched data from Binance to analyze increasing or decreasing price candles within specific time periods.

In 2023, I joined SEB (a banking institution) as a Bank Operations Specialist, where I began exploring automation possibilities in the banking sector. 
I learned about the robotic solutions used in banking and spent time developing scripts to automate daily tasks, enhancing the efficiency of routine operations.
